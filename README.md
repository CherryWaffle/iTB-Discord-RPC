## What is Discord RPC?

Discord RPC a.k.a Rich Presence is a library which interacts with your game on a local run Discord client. It shows your game status as an activity and many games support discord-invites to directly invite players via discord. It also shows other things like time played, your stats, etc..

## How does it work?

There is an API that communicates between your game and discord client to set a user's game activity, therefore by displaying the details of what the developers of that particular game have programmed. You need to have and run discord's local client in order for RPC's to work.
